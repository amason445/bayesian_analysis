# Bayesian Analysis - User Access Groups

## Summary and Results

A friend mentioned he was performing Bayesian Analysis on user groups at his job. He basically has to answer the questio, "Given a user is a member of a group, do they have access to any individual file?" I thought their problem was extremely interesting and I was coincidentally studying Bayes' Formula this weekend so I decided to write a Python script for a similar problem I thought of. I created a CSV of imaginary users, their job titles and imginary user access groups they are members of. 

Then, given this raw data I decided to calculate prior probabilities and posterior probabilities using Bayes' Formula with the below results.
